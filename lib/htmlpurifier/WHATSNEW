HTML Purifier 4.1 is a major security release that fixes an XSS
vulnerability exploitable on Internet Explorer.  It also contains
a number of new features, including dramatically more flexible Flash
support, including %Output.FlashCompat to replace %HTML.SafeEmbed,
optional support for the data: URI scheme and better HTML parsing
capabilities.
